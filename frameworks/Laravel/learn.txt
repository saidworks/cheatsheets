I.Start new project
1. Setup db and .env file 
2. Generate security key : php artisan key:generate
3. Create symblic link to the public directory to access stored medias: php artisan storage:link
4. Start the server : php artisan serve


II.Routing 
<?php

Route::get($uri, $callback);
?>

The router allows you to register routes that respond to any HTTP verb:

Route::get($uri, $callback);
Route::post($uri, $callback);
Route::put($uri, $callback);
Route::patch($uri, $callback);
Route::delete($uri, $callback);
Route::options($uri, $callback);

1. the router take first a string '/' then use a function to return the defined view.
Route::get('/', function () {
    return 'Hello, World!';
}); it can returns 
2. we can call a controller which will call it is view and put data from model in it like this :
Route::get('/user', [UserController::class, 'index']);
3.  We can use the 3rd word typed in the address like localhost/post/slug as parameter to call specific post from a blog for example like: 
Route::get('post/{slug}', [PostController::class, 'show']);
4. Named Routes
5.Redirected Routes: you can redirect to other routes like this Route::redirect('/here', '/there'); 

III. Model-View-Controller
1. Handle the link between business logic (backend/data) and presentation logic (frontend) 
2. We can call them using router Route::get('/', [ControllerName::class, 'method']);
3. We can define single action controller (contains only one method) :
class IndexController extends Controller
{
    //
    public function __invoke()
    {
        return view('welcome');
    }
}
when we call them we do not need a method in the arguments

Route::get('/', IndexController::class); 
4. Views : -Blade for view templates (checkout syntax cheatsheets)
	   -inside view('folder.name') '.' means '/' for path writing	
	   - there is no delete method in forms but we can access this using laravel method spoofing, in blade 		inside the form we can specify the method using @method('delete')  
5. Models: we can use the following commands to create the models: 
	-php artisan make:model ModelName 
	-php artisan make:model ModelName (-options: -m -mr)
	- we can use tinker to populate database's tables using : 
		php artisan tinker 
		App\Models\ModelName::factory()->times(n)->create([attributes of foreign keys])
		n: number of entries we want to create
	- we can create pivot table for managing many to many relationships like this:
		php artisan make:migration create_tablename_table --create=tablename
	- we can check if an entry is in a table using contains method and return true or false value:
		$this->likes->contains('user_id',$user->id); (Like and User are the table)

IV. Admin Panel (to be continued):
	-Nova official one developped by laravel team but paid
	-Voyager free :
		-download using : composer require tcg/voyager
		-install: php artisan voyager:install
